I am a PhD student in Mathematics from the [MAlgA](https://malga.art) research group of the Universities of Verona and Padova, working under the supervision of Lidia Angeleri-Hügel. My main areas of interest are Representation Theory and Homological Algebra, although I am constantly trying to learn new things--at the moment, dg categories and infinity-categories--looking for new ideas and potential collaborations.

I am currently doing research on cosilting mutation--a dual of large (i.e., infinite-dimensional) silting mutation--in extriangulated categories, aimed towards applications to the mutation of arbitrary torsion pairs of small (finitely generated) modules. You can find my preprints [here]() and a short presentation on extriangulated categories [here](), as well as a self-contained written introduction (in Spanish) [here](https://132.248.9.195/ptd2022/septiembre/0831398/Index.html).

Previously, I studied at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, where I was awarded an M. Sc. in Mathematics and a B. Sc in Biomedical Physics, taught several undergraduate courses (material of which can be found [here](https://github.com/dabnciencias?tab=repositories)), and lead a team of undergraduate students from the student-led project [Animathica](https://www.youtube.com/@animathica) to create [animated Linear Algebra videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL91agCMqt_mdAgHZkxyn-tscoNpu7ZHvl) (scripts and animation codes are [available as free software](https://github.com/animathica/alganim)).

I am also a music enthusiast, and I write, record and produce [my own music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rM7Q_QrzQk).

I am a Master's student enrolled in the Mathematical Sciences Graduate Program at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). My main areas of interest are Homological Algebra and Algebraic Topology. I am currently working on a thesis titled _Una introducción a las categorías extrianguladas_ ("An Introduction to Extriangulated Categories", in English) under the supervision of Dr. [Octavio Mendoza Hernández](https://www.matem.unam.mx/fsd/omendoza), who works at UNAM's [Institute of Mathematics](https://www.matem.unam.mx/).

I am also interested in education. I regularly teach undergraduate courses at UNAM's Faculty of Sciences, and I am currently involved with the animation group [Animathica](https://github.com/animathica) in a project where I collaborate with a group of undergraduate students from said Faculty to create [Linear Algebra videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oO6xXpaTLk).

I am also a music enthusiast, and I write, record and produce [my own music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rM7Q_QrzQk).

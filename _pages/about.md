I am a PhD student in Mathematics working under the supervision of Lidia Angeleri-Hügel as part of the [MAlgA group](https://malga.art). My main areas of interest are Representation Theory and Homological Algebra, although I am constantly trying to learn new things--such as dg categories and infinity-categories, at the moment--in the search for captivating ideas and potential collaborations.

I am currently doing research on cosilting mutation--a dual of infinite-dimensional silting mutation--in extriangulated categories, aimed towards applications to the mutation of arbitrary torsion pairs of finitely generated modules. Here are [my preprints]() and a self-contained [introduction to extriangulated categories](https://tesiunamdocumentos.dgb.unam.mx/ptd2022/septiembre/0831398/Index.html) (in Spanish).

I previously studied at UNAM (Mexico), where I [taught several undergraduate courses](https://dabnciencias.github.io/teaching) and led a team of undergraduates from the student project [Animathica](https://www.youtube.com/@animathica) to create [animated Linear Algebra videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL91agCMqt_mdAgHZkxyn-tscoNpu7ZHvl) (with English subtitles, code and scripts [available as free software](https://github.com/animathica/alganim)).

I am also a music enthusiast, and I write, record and produce [my own music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rM7Q_QrzQk).

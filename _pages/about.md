I am a M. Sc. in Mathematics and a B. Sc. in Biomedical Physics by the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). Currently, my main areas of interest are Homological Algebra and Algebraic Topology. You can check out my Master's thesis [here](http://132.248.9.195/ptd2022/septiembre/0831398/Index.html).

I am very passionate about Education. I regularly teach undergraduate courses at UNAM's Faculty of Sciences, and I am currently involved with the animation group [Animathica](https://github.com/animathica) in a project where I collaborate with a group of students from the aforementioned Faculty to create [Linear Algebra videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxcXCLAiQO0&list=PL91agCMqt_mdAgHZkxyn-tscoNpu7ZHvl).

I am also a music enthusiast, and I write, record and produce [my own music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rM7Q_QrzQk).

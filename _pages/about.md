I am a PhD student in Mathematics from the [MAlgA](https://malga.art) group, working under the supervision of Lidia Angeleri-Hügel. My main areas of interest are Representation Theory and Homological Algebra, although I am constantly trying to learn new things--such as dg categories and infinity-categories, at the moment--looking for new ideas and potential collaborations.

I am currently doing research on cosilting mutation--a dual of large (i.e., infinite-dimensional) silting mutation--in extriangulated categories, aimed towards applications to the mutation of arbitrary torsion pairs of finitely generated modules. You can find my preprints [here]() and a self-contained introduction to extriangulated categories (in Spanish) [here](https://132.248.9.195/ptd2022/septiembre/0831398/Index.html).

I previously studied at UNAM (Mexico), where I also [taught several undergraduate courses](https://dabnciencias.github.io/teaching) and lead a team of undergraduates in the student project [Animathica](https://www.youtube.com/@animathica) to create [animated Linear Algebra videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL91agCMqt_mdAgHZkxyn-tscoNpu7ZHvl) (scripts and animation codes are [available as free software](https://github.com/animathica/alganim)).

I am also a music enthusiast, and I write, record and produce [my own music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rM7Q_QrzQk).

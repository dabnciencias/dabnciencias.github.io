I am a PhD student in Mathematics at the Università degli Studi di Verona under the supervision of Lidia Angeleri-Hügel. My main areas of interest are Representation Theory and Homological Algebra, and I am currently doing research in (Co)Silting Theory and Mutations. You can check out my Master's thesis [here](http://132.248.9.195/ptd2022/septiembre/0831398/Index.html).

I taught undergraduate courses for several years at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, where I was awarded a M. Sc. in Mathematics and a B. Sc. in Biomedical Physics, and I was previously involved with the animation group [Animathica](https://www.youtube.com/@animathica) in a project in which I collaborated with a group of students to create [Linear Algebra videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL91agCMqt_mdAgHZkxyn-tscoNpu7ZHvl). Our scripts and animation codes are available as [free software](https://github.com/animathica/alganim).

I am also a music enthusiast, and I write, record and produce [my own music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rM7Q_QrzQk).

I taught a Computational Algorithms course (online) during the Spring semester of 2022, and will be doing so again in 2023. Course materials such as the syllabus, interactive notebooks, and project assignments are available (in Spanish) in [this repository](https://github.com/dabnciencias/AC), whereas lecture recordings may be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmXbDtHkE-I&list=PLtoBPDPjYod54trSakX0zW2AQPi9eevXm).

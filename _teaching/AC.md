I taught Computational Algorithms courses (online) during the Spring semesters of 2022 and 2023, mainly using the [Julia](https://julialang.org) programming language. Course materials such as the syllabus, interactive notebooks, and project assignments are available (in Spanish) at [this repository](https://github.com/dabnciencias/AC), whereas lecture recordings may be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmXbDtHkE-I&list=PLtoBPDPjYod54trSakX0zW2AQPi9eevXm).

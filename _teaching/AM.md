I am currently preparing two courses I hope to teach during the Spring semester, 2023: one on Group Theory and another on Programmatical Animation, the second of which is mainly focused on understanding and using the Python library [Manim](https://www.manim.community/) for visualizing mathematical concepts (for an example, see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oO6xXpaTLk&ab_channel=Animathica)). The materials for both courses will be made available in due time; the materials for the second course will be a fully fleshed out version of the work found in [this repository](https://github.com/animathica/seminario) (made in collaboration with some members of [Animathica](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzkyH2bxpesubzc87VxqDiA)).

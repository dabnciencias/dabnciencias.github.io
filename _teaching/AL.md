I taught several Linear Algebra courses, the first one -which started on January 27th, 2020- being initially in person and the rest being fully online. The course notes and exams (in Spanish) are available in [this repository](https://github.com/dabnciencias/AL).

I currently lead a team of undergraduate students with whom I create [educational Linear Algebra videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oO6xXpaTLk) for the student-lead animation project [Animathica](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzkyH2bxpesubzc87VxqDiA), working as creative director, editor and animator. All of our scripts (in Spanish) and code is available in [this repository](https://github.com/animathica/alganim/).

I taught several Linear Algebra courses, the first one -which started on January 27th, 2020- being initially in person and the rest being fully online, up until the end of 2021. The course notes and exams (in Spanish) are available in [this repository](https://github.com/dabnciencias/AL). In addition to my teaching activities, I also lead a team of undergraduate students with whom I created [educational Linear Algebra videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxcXCLAiQO0&list=PL91agCMqt_mdAgHZkxyn-tscoNpu7ZHvl) for the student-lead animation project [Animathica](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzkyH2bxpesubzc87VxqDiA), working as creative director, writer, animator, narrator and editor. All of our video scripts (in Spanish) and animation code may be found in [this repository](https://github.com/animathica/alganim/).

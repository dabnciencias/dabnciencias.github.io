Resumen: In many areas of mathematics we may find notions of "duality" which, however useful at an intuitive level, are often treated vaguely and left imprecise. In this talk, I aim to present a precise (albeit, somewhat informal -as in, not at the level of mathematical foundations) notion of duality in category theory, highlighting the role that categorical contexts have in the dualization of theorems. Along the way, we will understand the benefit of working with so called "self dual" categories, and we will sketch the proof that "the universe of categories of modules over a (commutative unital) ring is not dualizing" which, in particular, motivates the use of categorical structures such as abelian, exact, triangulated and extriangulated categories for the development of Homological Algebra.

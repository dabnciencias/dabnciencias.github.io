Near the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic -which forced teaching personnel all around the world to rapidly adapt to teaching at a distance- I gave a short workshop on how to utilize the [Telegram Messenger](https://telegram.org/) app as a powerful and versatile tool for online teaching to educators of the National Autonomous University of Mexico's Faculty of Sciences. A recording of the workshop (which was given in Spanish) can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6iM6L8fPWU).

Updates:
* A few months after this talk: Telegram added [group video call functionality](https://telegram.org/blog/group-video-calls/de?setln=en) (including screen sharing), effectively relinquishing the need for a supplementary application for synchronous sessions.
* A few years after this talk: Telegram is now widely used for educational purpouses at the Faculty of Sciences by teachers and students alike. 
* The recording of the workshop has accumulated more than 50,000 views (see link above).

**DISCLAIMER**
I am not sponsored by Telegram nor do I have any association with the app other than being a user; I've just found it extremely useful and comfortable for teaching :)

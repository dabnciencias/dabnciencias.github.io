Near the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic -which forced teaching personnel from all around the world to rapidly adapt to teaching at a distance- I gave a short workshop on how to use the [Telegram Messenger](https://telegram.org/) app as a powerful and versatile tool for online teaching to educators of the National Autonomous University of Mexico's Faculty of Sciences. A recording of the workshop (which was given in Spanish) can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6iM6L8fPWU).

This video illustrates the orthogonalization and orthonormalization processes in finite dimensional inner product spaces, while also explaining the Gram-Schmidt Theorem. The writing and narration was done in Spanish but English subtitles are also available. It was produced in collaboration with [Animathica](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzkyH2bxpesubzc87VxqDiA); the video script and animation code can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/animathica/alganim/tree/main/3).

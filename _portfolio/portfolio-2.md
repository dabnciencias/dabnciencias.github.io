title: "Inner product and orthogonal bases"
excerpt: "Video introducing the inner product as an operation which solves the problem of &quot;finding coefficients&quot; in a simple and scalable manner through the use of orthogonal (finite) bases; this result, in turn, allows us to interpret give the inner product its usual geometric interpretation. (Currently in production in collaboration with [Animathica](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzkyH2bxpesubzc87VxqDiA); the script and animation code can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/animathica/alganim).)"

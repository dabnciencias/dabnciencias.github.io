This video introduces the inner product as an operation that allows us to solve the problem of &quot;finding coefficients&quot; in finite-dimensional vector spaces in a simple and scalable manner through the use of orthogonal bases; a geometrical interpretation of the inner product is then presented. The writing and narration was done in Spanish but English subtitles are also available. It was produced in collaboration with [Animathica](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzkyH2bxpesubzc87VxqDiA); the video script and animation code can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/animathica/alganim/tree/main/1).
